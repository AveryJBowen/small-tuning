# Small Bagpipe Pitch Generator
## Background:
Bagpipe chanters are notoriously volatile, and anchor note pitch changes depending on weather conditions, temperature, and other things outside of the player's control.  Bagpipe chanter pitch is not based on an ordinary scale or predictable key.
## Purpose:
To take an initial bagpipe low-A pitch and calculate the other notes of the chanter scale and the drones based on it.

# Small Tuning
## Background:
Bagpipe chanters are notoriously volatile, and anchor note pitch changes depending on weather conditions, temperature, and other things outside of the player's control.  
## Purpose:
To take an initial bagpipe pitch and calculate the other notes of the chanter scale and the drones based on it.
